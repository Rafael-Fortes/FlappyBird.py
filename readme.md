# Flappy Bird with pygame

This is the first game that I created. In this project I learned a lot of Object Oriented Programing and how to work with pygame library.

I took the sprites from [this github repository](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets/tree/master/sprites).

In this game I used the **python3** and the **Pygame Library** (you can find the pygame docs [here](http://pygame.org/docs/)).

I hope you enjoy playing it, and someday I'll train a Neural Network to play the game.


# How to play

You just have to open the executable **Game.exe**.

Your goal on this game is to get the most score you can without touching the **pipes** or the **floor**. You can make the bird jumps by tapping the key **space** on you keyboard.
